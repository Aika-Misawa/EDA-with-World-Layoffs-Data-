# Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL: World-Layoffs

## Project Overview and Objectives
EDA with SQL using kaggle's world layoffs dataset. The goal for this project was to find meaningful/point of interests from the data set. From the data provided I was able to glean the following within the date range of July, 2023 and November, 2024:<br/>
1. Determine which industry was hit the hardest by layoffs<br/>
2. Determine which countries were hit the hardest by layoffs<br/>
3. Find out how many people in total were layed off<br/>
4. Determine which company stage had the most total of layoffs<br/>
5. Rolling total of layoffs per month within the date range
6. Rank the top 5 companies with the most lay offs for the year 2023 and 2024
